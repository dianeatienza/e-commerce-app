// Creates a Context Object
// A context object as the name states is a data type of an object that can be used to store information that can be shared to other components within the app.
// The context object is a different approach to passing information between components and allows easier access by avoiding the use of prop-drilling
const ProductContext = React.createContext();


// The "provider" component allows other components to consume/use the context object and supply the necessary information needed to the context object.
export const ProductProvider = ProductContext.Provider;

export default ProductContext;
